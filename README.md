# WebApptoPracticeAuthenticationFlaskDatabasesEtc

This is a website built with flask, html, css, python, and javascript to practice some backend and frontend concepts. It's supposed to be able to allow users
to take notes only accessible to them via their account. Feel free to try it out!

Probably should've named it a bit more concisely but I'm a comp sci student, not an english major.
